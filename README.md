# Calgary-Crimes-Dashboard

This repository contains the link to the dashboard for a recent Tableau project. The dashboard was created to analyze crime data, crime patterns and enhance seasonal preparedness strategies and deployment of resources effectively during peak periods of crimes which in turn helps to contribute to improving public safety and enhance data-driven decision-making and collaboration among stakeholders to address community safety challenges effectively.

 It includes 5 visualization sheets:
 1. Crimes Vs. Disorders per year
 2. Seasonal crime patterns
 3. Crime count by category
 4. Yearly crime trends
 5. Crime trends over time
